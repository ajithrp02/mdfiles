|<p>-----</p><p>**APPLIES TO:**</p><p>PeopleSoft Enterprise PT PeopleTools - Version 8.44 and later<br>Information in this document applies to any platform.</p><p><a name="goal"></a>**GOAL**</p><p>This document described how and when to run the Version Application Engine program to correct version counter inconsistencies in the PeopleSoft Application.</p><p><a name="fix"></a>**SOLUTION**</p><p>In a PeopleSoft Application, the PeopleTools infrastructure leverages metadata to manage much of the application's data. This metadata includes version counters that are used to control the caching of the metadata at various layers in the architecture. If these various version counters are not synchronized correctly, the effect can be significant and impact application integrity and performance.</p><p>PeopleTools Development has provided an Application Engine program called "VERSION" that helps manage these version counters. This document explains recent improvements to that program and explains when and how it should be run.</p><p><a name="aref_section21"></a>**Improvements to the VERSION Application Engine Program**</p><p>The VERSION program delivered from PeopleTools 8.0 through 8.52 had a very dramatic side effect that required the entire system to be quiesced before, and monitored closely after, each time the process ran. In PeopleTools 8.53, an updated VERSION program was delivered to enhance the program's capabilities. There are now three modes of operation:</p><p>a. Report mode - evaluates the metadata and reports version counter inconsistencies</p><p>b. Classic mode - restarts version counters, preserving the legacy behavior</p><p>c. Enhanced mode - advances version counters to a coherent state as needed</p><p>The updated VERSION program (v2) was included with PeopleTools 8.53 and 8.54 and is "backward compatible" to systems running PeopleTools 8.44 through 8.54. The most recent update (v3) was delivered after 8.54 GA and is compatible with PeopleTools 8.44 and later. (See the Change Log below for details.)  Oracle Support highly recommends the updated version be used for all implementation of PeopleTools from 8.44 and later.</p><p>The VERSION Application Engine program delivered PeopleTools 8.00 through 8.43 contains only the "Classic" mode described in this document. In versions of PeopleTools before 8.00, the program was delivered as an SQR and the information provided in this note does not apply to any.</p><p>For information regarding the installation of a PeopleTools Project, see PeopleBooks: <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E41633_01/pt853pbh1/eng/pt/tlcm/task_CopyingProjects-077379.html></p><p><a name="aref_section22"></a>**Introduction to the Modes of Operation**</p><p>There are three modes provided in the VERSION Application Engine Program. This section briefly described each of these modes.</p><p><a name="aref_section23"></a>***Report Mode***</p><p>Running the VERSION Program in the Report mode would be used to evaluate the status of the metadata version counters. It would provide indication whether correction may be necessary. Since there are no changes to the application metadata, there are no operational restrictions to the use of the program in this mode.</p><p><a name="aref_section24"></a>***Classic Mode***</p><p>The Classic mode is used to reset all the version counters to a starting value and should be required only rarely. Normally, the Classic mode would only be used when indicated by PeopleSoft Development in the documentation of an upgrade, or by PeopleSoft Support in response to a specific, critical issue described in a Service Request.</p><p>It is not uncommon for this mode to be used during a major Application Upgrade when the version counters need to be re-synchronized after the use of certain tools and techniques. As an example, it is common to use DataMover to load large amounts of PeopleTools data, but that program does not maintain version counter integrity while loading this data. Therefore, in certain cases to it is appropriate to reset the version counters after using this tool when a table controlled by metadata has been manipulated.</p><p>This mode should never be used from a Process Scheduler or from Application Designer. Furthermore, inappropriate use could have significant impact on the stability and performance of the application.</p><p><a name="aref_section25"></a>***Enhanced Mode***</p><p>This new mode advances version counters in such a way that PeopleTools processes will reload metadata in its designed, predicable manner.  Since some version counter inconsistencies are minor, they can be corrected "on the fly." This mode would be used when only minor problems are observed in the Report Mode.</p><p><a name="aref_section26"></a>**How to Run the VERSION Application Engine Program**</p><p>The VERSION Program is run differently for each mode of operation. This section will describe how each mode is used.</p><p><a name="aref_section27"></a>***Report Mode***</p><p>To run the VERSION Program in the Report mode, the run control name must be prefixed with the string "REPORTONLY" (case insensitive). Additional characters can be added to the end of name, but it must begin with that string.</p><p><a name="aref_section28"></a>***From a Command Line***</p><p>1\. Establish the proper shell environment. Normally this includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>a. logging in with your PeopleSoft Administrator id, and</p><p>b. running psconfig.sh</p><p>c. changing to the PSFT bin directory (i.e. cd $PS\_HOME/bin)</p><p>The typical startup script is configured to allow the user to start psadmin or run the DataMover from a command line.  To run psae.exe from a command line, the following environment vars may need to be added/redirected to the appropriate location for the process scheduler:<br><br>PS\_SERVDIR=$PS\_CFG\_HOME/appserv/prcs/YOUR\_DOMAIN\_GOES\_HERE; export PS\_SERVDIR<br>PS\_SERVER\_CFG=$PS\_CFG\_HOME/appserv/prcs/YOUR\_DOMAIN\_GOES\_HERE/psprcs.cfg; export PS\_SERVER\_CFG</p><p>2\. Execute the command From a Command Line</p><p>psae -CD <dbname> -CT <dbtype> -CO <oprid> -CP <pswd> -R REPORTONLY[optionalStringHere] -AI VERSION</p><p>3\. The output gets displayed in the Window where the program was executed. We strongly recommend you preserve the output - either copy/paste the output into a file, or to redirect the output to a file using the following syntax:</p><p>` `psae -CD <dbname> -CT <dbtype> -CO <oprid> -CP <pswd> -R REPORTONLY[optionalStringHere] -AI VERSION > AE\_VERSION.out</p><p><a name="aref_section29"></a>***From the Process Scheduler***</p><p>Execute the command from a process request</p><p>a. Navigate to PeopleTools > Application Engine > Request AE.</p><p>b. Use or add a run control begins with the string "REPORTONLY".  (If you choose to add a Run Control, enter i.) a user to run the request, ii.) a run control that begins with "REPORTONLY" and iii.) "VERSION" as the Program name.)</p><p>c. Set Process Frequency to "Always," so that this run control id can be used more than once.</p><p>d. Click Run.</p><p>e. Select a Server Name as desired.</p><p>f. Click on the check box next to VERSION.</p><p>g. Select Output Type as "Web" and the Output Format as "TXT."</p><p>h. Click OK.</p><p>Use the Process Monitor to observe the process and view the output. The output will be managed based on the configuration of the Process Scheduler and Report Distribution Agent.</p><p><a name="aref_section210"></a>***From Application Designer***</p><p>a. Sign on to the Application Designer</p><p>b. Select File > Open</p><p>c. Select "App Engine Program" from the drop down list on field "Definition"</p><p>d. Type in "VERSION" into the field "Name" and click return.</p><p>e. The VERSION program gets displayed in the right pane of the Application Designer.</p><p>f. Select Edit > Run Program and enter a Run Control ID that begins with the string "REPORTONLY" (case insensitive).</p><p>g. You will get the results in a new window. If you would like to save the output to a file, click on the check box labeled "Output Log to File" and specify a path.</p><p><a name="aref_section211"></a>***Classic Mode***</p><p>The VERSION Program in Classic mode is only from a command line and, even then, only under certain conditions.  This mode resets the version counters to a starting value and should only be used to address extreme inconsistencies in the version metadata.</p><p><a name="aref_section212"></a>***From a Command Line***</p><p>1\. Shut down all processes and clients of the PeopleSoft Application including Application Servers domains, Process Schedulers domains, Web Servers domains, and Application Designer, DataMover, PeopleTools Testing Framework, and any other PeopleTools clients. Ensure that all connections remain disconnected during the running of the VERSION Program run in Classic mode.</p><p>**Alert: Severe issues will likely occur if a given session of Application Designer is allowed to be active before and after the run of the Version program in Classic mode. Since there is no mechanism to force the shutting down of workstation-based clients, it is highly recommended that the database be restarted before running the VERSION Program in Classic mode. Restarting the database invalidates those connections and prevents this side effect.**</p><p>2\. Establish the proper shell environment. Normally this includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>a. logging in with your PeopleSoft Administrator id</p><p>b. running psconfig.sh</p><p>c. changing to the PSFT bin directory (i.e. cd $PS\_HOME/bin)</p><p>3\. Execute the command From a Command Line</p><p>Note: A run control name that begins with "RESETVERSIONS" (case insensitive) with no spaces will signal to the program to execute in Classic mode.</p><p>` `psae -CD <dbname> -CT <dbtype> -CO <oprid> -CP <pswd> -R RESETVERSIONS{yourRunControlName} -AI VERSION</p><p>3\. When the process completes, issue the following SQL and archive the output to ensure that the program ran as expected:</p><p>SELECT \* FROM PSVERSION ORDER BY VERSION DESC;</p><p>After the process completes, all the version counters should be "1." As the system is used, the version counter associated with SYS should remain the highest value.</p><p>4\. It is required after running the VERSION program in the Classic mode to clear the cache files from the Application Server, Web Servers, Process Schedulers, and Client processes. Refer to the following note:</p><p>[*Note: 753215.1 E-WS:How to Purge Cache for the PeopleSoft Application*](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=611565.1&id=753215.1 "How to Purge Cache")</p><p>5\. It is required after running the VERSION program in the Classic mode to restart the system per normal operational procedures. Anticipate that there will be a performance impact as the system rebuilds its cache files.</p><p>6\. Over the course of the following days, every few hours, rerun the SQL from the previous step. If the system is a production system, very few of the version counters should be changing of if they do, their growth should be incremental and gradual. For example, if password controls are enabled, the UPM value would grow with each login, or if users customize their home page, the PRUH version count would be seen to grow.</p><p><a name="aref_section213"></a>***From the Process Scheduler***</p><p>The Version program should never be run in the Classic mode from a process scheduler.</p><p><a name="aref_section214"></a>***From Application Designer***</p><p>The Version program should never be run in the Classic mode from Application Designer.</p><p><a name="aref_section215"></a>***Enhanced Mode***</p><p>The Enhanced mode is the preferred way to run the VERSION program. </p><p><a name="aref_section216"></a>***From a Command Line***</p><p>1\.

After the process completes, issue the following SQL and archive the output to ensure that the program ran as expected:</p><p>SELECT \* FROM PSVERSION ORDER BY VERSION DESC;</p><p>After the process completes in this mode, the version counter associated with SYS should be the highest value. Generally speaking, as the system is used that value should remain the highest value.</p><p>5\. Clearing the cache files from the Application Server, Web Servers, Process Schedulers, and Client processes should not normally be required after running the VERSION program in the Enhanced mode.</p><p><a name="aref_section217"></a>***From the Process Scheduler***</p><p>Execute the command from a process request</p><p>a.

You will get the results in a newly opened Window. If you would like to save the output to a file, click on the check box labeled "Output Log to File" and specify a path.</p><p><a name="aref_section219"></a>**Items for Further Consideration**</p><p>Should you observe one of the following conditions after running the VERSION program according the previous instructions, consider contacting Oracle Support for advice.</p><p>- The version counter associated with SYS is no longer greater to or equal all other version counters in the PSVERSION table. Generally speaking, the version counter associated with SYS will be greater than all other values in the table and the system is used. This is not always a reason to re-run the VERSION program, but it may be an indicator of possible issues.</p><p>- Version counter values are increasing or decreasing unexpectedly. It is considered normal behavior for the values to increment by 1 for each change made. For example, when a project is migrated, you should expect some values to increase depending on the number of associated records, fields, programs, etc. If password controls are enabled, then the values associated with User Profiles will increment as well. If the growth of these numbers is faster than expected, it may be an indicator of possible issues.  See Note: [1262255.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=611565.1&id=1262255.1 "Version Increases or Decreases Unexpectedly for Project Migrations") for more details.</p><p>- Some of the version counter values increase dramatically, often on the order of several thousand, and then remain fairly constant. This can often occur after the migration of a project from a database that has version counters that are not synchronized. In this case, first run the VERSION program on both the source and target database, rebuild the project, and then migrate it again.</p><p>If you suspect a recent project migration has caused the version counters to no longer be synchronized, use a query, such as the following, to help identify which project may be involved:</p><p>SELECT PROJECTNAME, LASTUPDDTTM, LASTUPDOPRID, VERSION</p><p>FROM PSPROJECTDEFN</p><p>WHERE VERSION >= 1 -- set this threshold as appropriate</p><p>ORDER BY LASTUPDDTTM DESC</p><p>If a version counter is a value dramatically larger than the rest, the other fields in that row may give you an indication which project migration was problematic and which OPRID was used to do the migration.</p><p><a name="aref_section220"></a>**Frequently Asked Questions**</p><p>1\.  What are common output messages and what do they mean?</p>|||

|<p> </p><p><a name="aref_section221"></a>**Change Log**</p><p>v2 (Aug 7, 2103):</p><p>1. Added new Enhanced and Reporting modes so that program can be run in many cases without a total system outage.</p><p>2. Backward compatible from 8.44 through 8.54</p><p>v3 (Aug 4, 2014):</p><p>1. Enhanced display header. Added a header to the report containing: version number of the VERSION program, PeopleTools release, date, description of the selected mode.</p><p>2. RowsetCache is no longer deleted in Enhanced mode. If there are any entries in file cache or db cache they would not be properly deleted, resulting in stale objects in the cache. The RowsetCache is simply synchronized like other object types.</p><p>3. Added a warning if the SYS row in PSVERSION is less than other rows in PSVERSION.
